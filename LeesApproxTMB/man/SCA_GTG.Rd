\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the Data object (by default, equal to one for assessments).}

\item{Data}{An object of class Data}

\item{SR}{Stock-recruit function (either \code{"BH"} for Beverton-Holt or \code{"Ricker"}).}

\item{vulnerability}{Whether estimated vulnerability is \code{"logistic"} or \code{"dome"} (double-normal).
See details for parameterization.}

\item{CAA_multiplier}{Numeric for data weighting of catch-at-age matrix.
Default is set to zero to ignore age comp data.}

\item{CAL_multiplier}{Numeric for data weighting of catch-at-length matrix.
Default is set to zero to ignore length comp data.}

\item{ngtg}{Integer, the number of growth type groups in the model.}

\item{max_sd_gtg}{The number of standard deviations to span the GTGs across the length-at-age distribution.}

\item{use_LeesEffect}{Logical, whether to incorporate Lee's effect in the model.}

\item{truncate_CAL}{Logical, whether to truncate the length composition data at the tails if the length bins are outside the
range of lengths of all growth type groups.}

\item{I_type}{Whether the index surveys population biomass (B; this is the default in the DLMtool operating model),
vulnerable biomass (VB), or spawning stock biomass (SSB).}

\item{rescale}{A multiplicative factor that rescales the catch in the assessment model, which
can improve convergence. By default, \code{"mean1"} scales the catch so that time series mean is 1, otherwise a numeric.
Output is re-converted back to original units.}

\item{max_age}{Integer, the maximum age (plus-group) in the model.}

\item{start}{Optional list of starting values. Entries can be expressions that are evaluated in the function. See details.}

\item{fix_h}{Logical, whether to fix steepness to value in \code{Data@steep} in the model for \code{SCA}. This only affects
calculation of reference points for \code{SCA2}.}

\item{fix_F_equilibrium}{Logical, whether the equilibrium fishing mortality prior to the first year of the model
is estimated. If \code{TRUE}, \code{F_equilibrium} is fixed to value provided in \code{start} (if provided),
otherwise, equal to zero (assumes unfished conditions).}

\item{fix_omega}{Logical, whether the standard deviation of the catch is fixed. If \code{TRUE},
sigma is fixed to value provided in \code{start} (if provided), otherwise, value based on \code{Data@CV_Cat}.}

\item{fix_sigma}{Logical, whether the standard deviation of the index is fixed. If \code{TRUE},
sigma is fixed to value provided in \code{start} (if provided), otherwise, value based on \code{Data@CV_Ind}.}

\item{fix_tau}{Logical, the standard deviation of the recruitment deviations is fixed. If \code{TRUE},
tau is fixed to value provided in \code{start} (if provided), otherwise, value based on \code{Data@sigmaR}.}

\item{early_dev}{Character string describing the years for which recruitment deviations are estimated in \code{SCA}. By default, \code{"comp_onegen"}
rec devs are estimated one full generation prior to the first year when catch-at-age (CAA) data are available. With \code{"comp"}, rec devs are
estimated starting in the first year with CAA. With \code{"all"}, rec devs start at the beginning of the model.}

\item{late_dev}{Typically, a numeric for the number of most recent years in which recruitment deviations will
not be estimated in \code{SCA} (recruitment in these years will be based on the mean predicted by stock-recruit relationship).
By default, \code{"comp50"} uses the number of ages (smaller than the mode)
for which the catch-at-age matrix has less than half the abundance than that at the mode.}

\item{integrate}{Logical, whether the likelihood of the model integrates over the likelihood
of the recruitment deviations (thus, treating it as a random effects/state-space variable).
Otherwise, recruitment deviations are penalized parameters.}

\item{silent}{Logical, passed to \code{\link[TMB]{MakeADFun}}, whether TMB
will print trace information during optimization. Used for dignostics for model convergence.}

\item{opt_hess}{Logical, whether the hessian function will be passed to \code{\link[stats]{nlminb}} during optimization
(this generally reduces the number of iterations to convergence, but is memory and time intensive and does not guarantee an increase
in convergence rate). Ignored if \code{integrate = TRUE}.}

\item{n_restart}{The number of restarts (calls to \code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}) in the optimization procedure, so long as the model
hasn't converged. The optimization continues from the parameters from the previous (re)start.}

\item{control}{A named list of agruments for optimization to be passed to
\code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}.}

\item{inner.control}{A named list of arguments for optimization of the random effects, which
is passed on to \code{\link[TMB]{newton}}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed.}

\item{fix_U_equilibrium}{Logical, same as \code{fix_F_equilibrium} for \code{SCA_Pope}.}

\item{common_dev}{Typically, a numeric for the number of most recent years in which a common recruitment deviation will
be estimated (in \code{SCA2}, uninformative years will have a recruitment closer to the mean, which can be very misleading,
especially near the end of the time series). By default, \code{"comp50"} uses the number of ages (smaller than the mode)
for which the catch-at-age matrix has less than half the abundance than that at the mode.}
